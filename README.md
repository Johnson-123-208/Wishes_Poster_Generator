Premium Greeting Card Generator 🎉
Welcome to the Premium Greeting Card Generator! This is a heartfelt project that lets you create beautiful, personalized greeting cards for any occasion—birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, and more. Whether you’re sending love to a friend, celebrating a colleague’s milestone, or thanking a family member, this tool makes it easy to craft stunning cards with a touch of your own personality.
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this generator is user-friendly, fully customizable, and packed with elegant designs. I created this to spread joy and make it simple for anyone to create meaningful, professional-looking cards in just a few clicks.
Features That Make It Special 💖

8 Gorgeous Templates: Choose from themes like Royal Purple, Golden Luxury, Minimalist, Romantic Blush, and more to match the vibe of your occasion.
Personalized Messages: Pick from pre-written, heartfelt messages (professional or friendly) or write your own custom message.
Photo Upload: Add a personal photo in a stylish circular frame, with drag-and-drop positioning and resizing in Live Editor mode (currently commented out but easy to enable!).
Flexible Options: Customize for birthdays, anniversaries, weddings, graduations, retirements, New Year, congratulations, or thank-yous, with tailored tones and recipient types (e.g., friend, colleague, or specific family members).
Responsive Design: Looks great on desktops, tablets, and phones, with smooth scaling for smaller screens.
Download Ready: Save your card as a high-quality PNG or JPG with one click, thanks to the html2canvas library.
No External Images Needed: All designs are crafted with pure CSS (gradients, shadows, ornaments) for a lightweight and fast experience.

Why I Built This
I wanted to create something that makes celebrating life’s moments easy and meaningful. Whether it’s a quick “Happy Birthday” or a thoughtful “Thank You,” this generator helps you express your feelings with style and care. The clean code and customizable options make it a fun tool for anyone to use or build upon.
